# Mimesis

**Mimesis refers to the imitation, representation, or copying of something, particularly the portrayal of reality in art.**

*This game is based on this imitation principle and you can play this from [Mimesis](https://tempestyash123456.github.io/Mimesis/).*

### Objective 

The goal of the game is to successfully repeat increasingly complex sequences of colored lights and sounds displayed by the Mimesis unit. You reach furthur levels with each correct sequence, and the game gets more challenging as you progress.

### Gameplay

1. *Start the game:*

   Press the'A' key on your keyboard.
2. *Starting sequence:*

   The Mimesis unit will display a single colored light accompanied by a corresponding sound (e.g., green light and a high-pitched beep).
3. *Your turn:*

   After the light sequence is displayed, it's your turn to repeat it. Press the corresponding colored button on the screen in the exact order they were shown.
4. *Correct response:*

   If you press the button correctly, the Mimesis unit will continue to display the next sequence, adding one additional color and sound.
5. *Incorrect response:*

   If you press the wrong button or take too long to respond, the Mimesis unit will play an error sound and display flashing lights, indicating you're out. The game ends, and you are required to press any key to restart the game.
6. *Continue playing:*

   If you correctly repeat a sequence, the game continues with increasing difficulty by adding more colors and sounds to the sequence.

### Example

1. You start the game, and the Mimesis unit displays a green light and sound.
2. You correctly press the green button.
3. The Mimesis unit now displays a yellow light and its corresponding sound.
4. You need to press the green button followed by the yellow button in the correct order to succeed.
5. If you manage that, the Mimesis unit might display a red light and corresponding sound.
6. The game continues adding more colors and sounds to the sequence as long as you keep replicating them accurately.
7. If you miss a button or take too long at any point, the game ends, and press any key to restart.
